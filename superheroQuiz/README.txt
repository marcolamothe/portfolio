Hi there,
I am Marc-Olivier Lamothe, a Design student at Concordia University.

You are probably wondering what were my intentions behind the ?quiz? I made on my website. Well, here is where I am going to explain everything.

So, the website is basically a web intervention made to open the eyes of the people who don?t realise how easy it is to gather information about them. My website, on a first look, seems to be just a fun little quiz to pass the time. But actually, I am getting a lot of useful information about the user, information that some big companies would probably be interested into buying. I could have kept the information in a secret bank, without the user knowing it, and they would have thought it was just a fun game... But instead, I chose to do the opposite. I chose to spam the user with popups every time information was shared from him to the website, so the user would realize how a little quiz on the internet can be hiding other goals then just entertaining people. 

The website itself is made to bring the user to his/her own conclusion about the subject. I do not explicitly say ?look how I am using the information you are giving me to sell you stuff?, but it becomes more and more obvious as you go through the website. At the start, you choose your favourite colour. It does absolutely nothing; I am not even saving this information for later. It is just to start the quiz with something fun so the user does not suspect anything at the beginning. The page that comes after is a text box, in which you have to write what motivates you (your goals in life). When the text is done, the user presses the button, and that is when everything starts being disturbing for him. If the site is able to find one or more keyword in what the user wrote, it starts opening pages in forms of pop ups related to what he just wrote. The website uses different methods to acquire information about the viewer. We just saw how it can analyse text, but later in the other pages it is also getting the location of the user to propose him local spa centres, or using interactive drag and drop mini-game to make him say what kind of trip he prefers. At the end, if it is not already clear in the mind of the user that the website uses the information given to spam him/her, it just becomes impossible to miss, as the website generate an awful amount of webpages based on what information he gave earlier just as the user enters the last page. The website evens continue to open pop up pages quickly as long as it is running, making it very annoying and frustrating.

So to conclude, my website is made to look like a fun quiz, but meant to show the person using it how easy it is to gather information on the Internet, whatever the context is. I do not say it explicitly, but the repetition of the pop ups that uses freshly extracted information makes it obvious before you arrive at the end. The end is just to show how unpleasant it can be to get spammed with stuff that ?should? interest you (which is sadly something that happens, in a more subtle way, in your everyday life on the Internet ? social medias being usually one of those most common places if you are on any).
